# Lazy Load Images with Intersection Observer

This mini application utilizes the Intersection Observer API to implement lazy loading of images.
Images are loaded dynamically as they come within 100 pixels of the viewport. 

This technique improves the performance of web pages by reducing initial load times and network requests.
